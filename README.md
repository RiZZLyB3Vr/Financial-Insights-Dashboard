# Financial Insights Dashboard 

Hey there! Thanks for checking out my personal finance dashboard project. I built this to not only practice my data skills but also to gain a deeper understanding of spending habits and financial health. This dashboard takes a simple dataset and turns it into a powerful, interactive tool for financial analysis.

### What Can You Do with This Dashboard?

-   **See Your Financial Snapshot:** Quickly view key metrics like total income, total expenses, and net income at a glance with easy-to-read cards.
-   **Find Out Where Your Money Goes:** Instantly see the breakdown of spending across different categories with a clear treemap and matrix.
-   **Model a "What If" Scenario:** Play with the "What If" slider to see how a hypothetical change in income would affect your net savings.
-   **Explore Deeper Trends:** Use the scatter plot and bar charts to discover patterns, like how income relates to age or occupation.

### My Toolbox for This Project

-   **Power BI:** The main tool used to build the entire dashboard.
-   **Power Query:** I used this to clean the dataset, handle a few inconsistencies, and create new columns like `Total_Expenses`.
-   **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** This is the formula language I used to create key measures like `Net Income` and `Savings Variance`.
